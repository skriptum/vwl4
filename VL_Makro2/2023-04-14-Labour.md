## The Labour Market

**Wage Setting:** takes place in the firm: wage above *unemployment rent*

- beased on unemployment rate
- other firms wages

**Price Setting:** as markup above cost of production

- other firms prices
- own costs and wages
- position of demand curve (elasticity)

=> adding up decisions = real wage and unemployment rate

Decision Process

| Department | Knows                       | Sets                |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------------- |
| HR         | prices, wages, unempl. Rate | nominal Wage *W*    |
| Marketing  | demand curve position       | Price of output *p* |
| Production | labor productivity          | Employment *n*      |

Procution Function of Firm:
$$
Y = \underset{labor\ productiity}{\lambda} \cdot \underset{workers}{n}
$$



## Wage Setting Curve

Wages in aggregate economy:

Influences:

- unemployment benefits -> curve upwards
- labor supply increases -> curve downwards



## Isoprofit Curve

Firm maximizes profit

- based on elasticity of demand (inverse)
- and level of competition (inverse)

$$
\frac{1}{elasticity} = \frac{price-MC}{price} = \mu \\
with \; MC = \frac{W = nominal \ Wage}{\lambda = labor \ productivity }
$$

leads to price setting curve: (p.w. = per worker)
$$
\implies \underbrace{\frac{W}{P}}_{real \ Wage} = \underbrace{\lambda}_{output \ p.w.} - \underbrace{\lambda \cdot \mu}_{real \ profit \ p.w.}
$$
note:

- wage = $\lambda$
- high competition = low $\mu$ = high wages



## Equilibrium

**wage-setting curve**: wage required at level of empl. for effort

**Price-setting curve**: real wage based on comp, productivitiy

Nash-Equilibrium:

- firms offer least wage for effort
- employment highest it can be
- unemployed cannot imporve situation

leads to:

### Involuntary Unemployment

> **involuntary unemployment:** people at working age willing to supply labor but not finding a job

- excess supply in labor market
- always exists
- due to incomplete contracts, not policy!



### Demand and Unemployment

Firms *labor demand* depends on *Demand for Goods* => **derived demand for labor**

- depends on aggregate demand
- Fall in AD => demand-deficient unemployment



**theory:**

- firms adjust wages to lower point
- lower costs -> lower prices 
- increased output

**reality**:

- no cuts to wages
- lower wages = less AD
- falling prices = deflation

=> Government Intervention helps
