## Intertemporal Optimization

Borrowing brings consumtpion to Future

- r = interest rate
- tradeoff = 1+r
- Repayment = principal + interest rate
- $91 (1+r) = 100$ , with r=10%

**Impatience**: Preference for present consumption

- measured by **discount rate** 
- affected by **desire to smooth** consumption



### Equilibrium

at Point where
$$
MRS = MRT \implies 1+p = 1+r
$$
with different endowments

- Julia = 100 in future (wants to borrow)
- Marco = 100 now (wants to save)
