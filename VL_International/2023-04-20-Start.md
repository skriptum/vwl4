## Gravity Model

How much do people trade with each other? 


$$
T_ij = \frac{A \times Y_i \times Y_j}{D_{ij}}
$$

- A = constant term
- D = Distance
- Y = GDP of respective country



Anomalies: (EU and US)

- Ireland = cultural affinity
- Netherlands = transport cost advantages

=> more Trade than predicted



other Aspects (not in Model):

- cultural affinity
- geography
- Multinational Corps.
- Borders
